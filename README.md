# hello-world
Gotta start somewhere...

Went to school for Finance, enjoyed my time and glad I earned a degree.  

I think, however, that coding might be what truly interests me.  

So I've decided to follow a loose guidline as follows:
  Year 1 -> Learn basic coding (e.g. Codecademy, Coursera, GitHub)
  Year 2 - 3 -> Decide on a bootcamp (e.g. Free Code Camp)
  Year 3 (End) -> Interview for jobs and determine if this is the right move
